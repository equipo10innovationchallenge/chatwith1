You can take the subway to Station A and walk for about 8 minutes from exit A53. Alternatively, you can take the train to S Station and walk for about 12 minutes from the south exit3.\nHuman: Show me more restaurants.\n\nOutput: best restaurants nearby\nEND OF EXAMPLE\n\nConversation history (for reference only):\nHuman: What is ChatGPT?\nAI: ChatGPT is a chatbot product developed by OpenAI. It is powered by the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series of language models, with GPT-4 being the latest version. ChatGPT uses natural language processing to generate responses to user inputs in a conversational manner. It was released as ChatGPT Plus, a premium version, which provides enhanced features and access to the GPT-4 based version of OpenAI's API. ChatGPT allows users to interact and have conversations with the language model, utilizing both text and image inputs. It is designed to be more reliable, creative, and capable of handling nuanced instructions compared to previous versions. However, it is important to note that while GPT-4 improves upon its predecessors, it still retains some of the same limitations and challenges.\nHuman: define he sun in 5 words\n\nOutput:"

Also celestial object..\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Glossary of astronomy\n\nContent: Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) is a fusion energy process that initiates nuclear fusion reactions by compressing and heating targets filled with fuel. The targets are small pellets, typically containing deuterium (2H) and tritium (3H).. Energy is deposited in the target's outer layer, which explodes outward. This produces a reaction force in the form of shock waves that travel through the target. The waves compress and heat it. Sufficiently powerful shock waves will cause fusion of the fuel.. ICF is one of two major branches of fusion energy research; the other is magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). When first proposed in the early 1970s, ICF appeared to be a practical approach to power production and the field flourished. Experiments demonstrated that the efficiency of these devices was much lower than expected. Throughout the 1980s and '90s, experiments were conducted in order to understand the interaction of high-intensity laser light and plasma.\nSource: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=Inertial confinement fusion "
